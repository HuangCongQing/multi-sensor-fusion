Someone asked about the complexity of SVD computation.

According to my Golub&Van Loan book on "Matrix Computations" (which is 
pretty much the definitive book on the subject), the best algorithms for 
SVD computation of an mxn matrix take time that is proportional to is O(k 
m^2 n + k'  n^3) (k and k' are constants which are 4 and 22 for an 
algorithm called R-SVD.

You can get by with just O(mn^2) if you need only the set of singular 
values and not the U and V matrices.
